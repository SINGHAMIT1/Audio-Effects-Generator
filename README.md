# Audio-Effects-Generator
The goal of this project was to generate audio effects. We used audio as input and processed it 
through our FRDM-K64 board to create different audio effects by altering the input audio. Some 
of the audio effects successfully implemented in this project include ECHO, REVERB, 
SLAPBACK, PANNING, and CHORUS. The first three are delay-based audio effects, the fourth 
is spectral, and the final is modulation-based audio effects. The FRDM-K64F board, the Wolfson 
Pi Audio Card, Keil MDK-ARM and MATLAB Simulink were used to create these audio effects. 
These audio effects can be used for a variety of purposes, including music recording and mixing, 
voice changers, fun sound effects and noises, bass boosters, and equalizers. In the not-too-distant 
future, we may be able to make the system wireless and based on the internet of things.
